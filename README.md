# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O :

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange a collection of elements in a particular order. This order can be ascending (smallest to largest), descending (largest to smallest), or based on a custom comparison function.Some common sorting algorithms include:

* `Bubble sort`.
* `Selection sort`.
* `Insertion sort`.
* `Merge sort`.
* `Quick sort` .


Big O notation is a mathematical way to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity. It tells us how the running time of the algorithm grows as the input size increases. Common Big O complexities for sorting algorithms include:

 * `O(n^2)`.
 * `O(n log n`.
 * `O(n)`.
